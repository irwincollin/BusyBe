# BusyBe
A python 2, openCV project that analyzes how busy a location is through image or video analysis

Currently I am just getting started. My first milestone is simply to have the entire project and its dependencies ready to go. 

My next steps will be: image downloading through HTTP, openCV background removal, openCV blob detection, and logging blob activity

This project is the first part of my new year's resolution to code, and commit, every day. I also want to learn some basics of computer vision.
