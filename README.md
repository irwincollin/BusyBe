# BusyBe
A python 2, openCV project that analyzes how busy a location is through image or video analysis

Currently I am just getting started. My first milestone is simply to have the entire project and its dependencies ready to go. 

My next steps will be: image downloading through HTTP, openCV background removal, openCV blob detection, and logging blob activity

This project is the first part of my new year's resolution to code, and commit, every day. I also want to learn some basics of computer vision


Current setup steps

Download and install latest 32-bit python 2.* package NOTE: Make sure that you mark the 'set path' option during install.

Download and install latest numpy superpack for python 2.*

Download and install latest scipy superpack for python 2.*

Download and run the self-extracting ZIP for openCV 2.4. Remember where you extract OpenCV to. NOTE: I tried used the latest 'stab'e openCV and it was too buggy to use.

Copy \openc\build\python\2.7\cv2.pyd from the place you extracted OpenCV to c:\python2.7\lib\site-packages
Reboot!

Navigate to the sources\samples\ directory in your OpenCV directory and run some tests. hist.py, for example, was my first test.
